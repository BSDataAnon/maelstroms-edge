      <description>Characters can use the Join Unit free action if they’ve not yet been activated: Join a unit within 3” when it is activated, before its discipline check; move the character within 3” of as many models in the unit as possible, facing the same direction (fixed move). Only keep the highest number of STs, and then add any STs gained by the character’s move. A character may not join other characters or model with the Solo designator. Leave a unit by making an activation check for the unit: if it’s successful, the character counts as having been activated alone and acts independently of the unit. The unit can activate later.</description>

      <description>Behemoths have the following abilities:
·         Overrun (exclusive): Can move through (overrun) standard-sized enemy units. Enemy units can fire defensively at a unit that overruns them at their choice of AV.
·         Fearless (squad): The unit ignores psych STs, is never shell-shocked, pinned, or required to retreat or flee the battle. It does not take suppressive fire discipline checks or CQ discipline checks. When performing a Shaken action, the unit must either make a single move or remain stationary and fire a single round of wild shooting. Upon completing a Dig-in or Shaken action, shake-off the extra D3 STs as though it were pinned. Does not apply if squad leader is not fearless.
·         Heavy Gunner: Ignore the Heavy ability, except when CQ fighting.
·         Kill Mission: This unit cannot control mission objective markers, but can still contest them.
·         Massive Strength: If a model’s primary CQ weapon is a melee weapon: add +1 DAM, and its PEN value is double the model’s MAS. Ignore the Heavy ability during CQ fighting.

As large models, they follow these rules:
·         Directional movement: Non-fixed and non-dynamic movement can only be forward or reverse. A number of pivots up to 90° is allowed, limited to half the model’s EVS. Moving in reverse, MV is halved and only 1 pivot is allowed. End-of-move pivot for required facing is always allowed.
·         Large models and terrain:
	o    Large models are never in cover;
	o    Standard-sized models never count as partially obscuring a large model;
	o    Terrain features only partially obscure a large model if they obscure at least 50% of its body;
	o    Large models only count as being partially obscured for being within an area terrain feature if their entire base is within it and it’s not low area terrain.
·         Large model shooting: Large models can fire a number of weapons up to their FOR characteristic (see p. 65 for multiple weapons in CQ).
·         Explode: When a large model becomes a casualty, it explodes on a 5+. This causes a special attack emanating from the base of the model using the model’s MAS vs. the targets’ EVS. Explosion profile: RNG=1/2MAS+D3&quot; SHO=MASx2 PEN=MAS DAM=1.</description>

      <description>Vehicles have the following abilities:
·         Overrun (exclusive): Can move through (overrun) standard-sized enemy units. Enemy units can fire defensively at a unit that overruns them at their choice of AV.
·         Fearless (squad): The unit ignores psych STs, is never shell-shocked, pinned, or required to retreat or flee the battle. It does not take suppressive fire discipline checks or CQ discipline checks. When performing a Shaken action, the unit must either make a single move or remain stationary and fire a single round of wild shooting. Upon completing a Dig-in or Shaken action, shake-off the extra D3 STs as though it were pinned. Does not apply if squad leader is not fearless.
·         Heavy Gunner: Ignore the Heavy ability, except when CQ fighting.
·         Kill Mission: This unit cannot control mission objective markers, but can still contest them.

As large models, they follow these rules:
·         Directional movement: Non-fixed and non-dynamic movement can only be forward or reverse. A number of pivots up to 90° is allowed, limited to half the model’s EVS. Moving in reverse, MV is halved and only 1 pivot is allowed. End-of-move pivot for required facing is always allowed.
·         Large models and terrain:
	o    Large models are never in cover;
	o    Standard-sized models never count as partially obscuring a large model;
	o    Terrain features only partially obscure a large model if they obscure at least 50% of its body;
	o    Large models only count as being partially obscured for being within an area terrain feature if their entire base is within it and it’s not low area terrain.
·         Large model shooting: Large models can fire a number of weapons up to their FOR characteristic (see p. 65 for multiple weapons in CQ).
·         Explode: When a large model becomes a casualty, it explodes on a 5+. This causes a special attack emanating from the base of the model using the model’s MAS vs. the targets’ EVS. Explosion profile: RNG=1/2MAS+D3&quot; SHO=MASx2 PEN=MAS DAM=1.

Also:
1) Vehicles treat area terrain and obstacles they move into, out of and over as dangerous ground. Vehicles cannot ascend or descend vertical terrain at all, though they can traverse gentle slopes up or down a hill.
2) A Vehicle’s body is considered to be any part of the model except for gun barrels, antennae and any purely decorative items that are inconsequential towards the operation of the vehicle, such as banners, chains, etc. As always, any element considered not to be part of the model’s body is ignored while drawing line of sight. Unlike other models’ bodies, a vehicle’s body can completely obscure line of sight exactly like a terrain obstacle. However, vehicles that are part of the unit checking line of sight, as well as vehicles in a unit being spotted, are still ignored.
3) Vehicles cannot perform a Charge action, and cannot perform reactive CQ fighting.</description>
